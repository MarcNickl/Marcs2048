# App Icon Setup Instructions

## Your 2048 Logo Integration

I've set up the complete iOS app icon structure for your project. Here's what I've done:

### âœ… Completed Setup:
1. **Created Asset Catalog**: `Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/`
2. **Added to Xcode Project**: The asset catalog is now properly integrated
3. **Generated Icon Script**: `generate_icons.sh` ready to use
4. **Project Configuration**: Updated to use the new AppIcon asset

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps to Add Your Logo:

1. **Save your 2048 logo** (the yellow image with red "2048" text) as a PNG file
   - Recommended size: 1024x1024 pixels minimum
   - Name it something like `2048-logo.png`

2. **Run the icon generation script**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project/ios-swift
   ./generate_icons.sh path/to/your/2048-logo.png
   ```

3. **Open in Xcode**: The icons will automatically appear in your project

### ðŸ“± Required Icon Sizes Generated:
- 40x40 (20pt @2x)
- 60x60 (20pt @3x) 
- 58x58 (29pt @2x)
- 87x87 (29pt @3x)
- 80x80 (40pt @2x)
- 120x120 (40pt @3x)
- 120x120 (60pt @2x)
- 180x180 (60pt @3x)
- 1024x1024 (App Store)

### ðŸ”§ Manual Alternative:
If you prefer to create the icons manually:
1. Resize your logo to each size listed above
2. Save them with the exact filenames shown in `Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/Contents.json`
3. Place them in the `Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/` folder

Your project is now ready to receive the icons! ðŸš€
